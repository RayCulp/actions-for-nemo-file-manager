# Actions for Nemo file manager
## A collection of Actions and associated scripts for the Linux file manager [Nemo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nemo_(file_manager))
### Introduction
Nemo is the official file manager of the Cinnamon desktop environment. It is used, for example, in the Linux distro [Linux Mint](https://www.linuxmint.com/). Nemo can also be [installed on Ubuntu](https://itsfoss.com/install-nemo-file-manager-ubuntu/). Nemo's functionality (which is already excellent out-of-the-box) can be extended even further using what are known as [Actions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csbMSmjGmPo).

As a person who recently switched from Windows to Linux, one of the most puzzling things about Linux was how empty the context menu of the file manager remained, even after installing many programs that would have most certainly added context menu items to Windows Explorer. 

For example, [JAM Software TreeSize](https://www.jam-software.com/treesize_free/features.shtml) is a Windows utility that allows you to quickly analyze disk usage. One decent Linux alternative is [QDirStat](https://github.com/shundhammer/qdirstat). However, unlike TreeSize, QDirStat does not add any context menu items to the file manager, so you must start the program manually and then navigate to the drive you would like to analyze from inside of the program.

This repository is my humble contribution to remedying this state of affairs.
